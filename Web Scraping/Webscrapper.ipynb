      "Ex-finance minister wins Costa Rica’s presidential runoff despite harassment allegations\n",
      "A former finance minister who surprised many by making it into Costa Rica’s presidential runoff vote has easily won the election and is to become the Central American country’s new leader next month, while still fending off accusations of sexual harassment when he worked at the World Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "With nearly all polling stations reporting late Sunday, conservative economist Rodrigo Chaves had 53% of the vote, compared to 47% for former President José Figueres Ferrer, the Supreme Elections Tribunal said.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 42% of eligible voters did not participate in Sunday’s election, however, reflecting the lack of enthusiasm Costa Ricans had for the candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his victory speech, Chaves said he received the result with humility and called for unity to address problems such as unemployment and the soaring budget deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "“For me this is not a medal nor a trophy but rather an enormous responsibility, heaped with challenges and difficulties that we will all resolve,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Costa Rica, the best is to come!” Chaves said before celebrating with supporters. His inauguration is scheduled for May 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figueres conceded defeat less than an hour after results began to come in. He had led the first round of voting Feb. 6, with Chaves in second place that day, but neither came close to the 40% of the vote needed to avoid a runoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Costa Rica has voted and the people have spoken,” Figueres said. “As the democrats we are, we will always be respectful of that decision.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He congratulated Chaves and wished him the best, adding that he continued to believe Costa Rica was in a “deep crisis” and that he was willing to help it recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figueres, who was Costa Rica’s president from 1994 to 1998, represents the National Liberation Party, as did his father, three-time president José Figueres Ferrer. Chaves served briefly in the administration of outgoing President Carlos Alvarado and represents the Social Democratic Progress Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "World & Nation Costa Rica legalizes same-sex marriage Costa Rica became the latest country to legalize same-sex marriage early Tuesday when a ruling from its high court went into effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both men waged a bruising campaign that highlighted past controversies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chaves’ campaign is under investigation by electoral authorities for allegedly running an illegal parallel financing structure. He also has been dogged by a sexual harassment scandal that drove him out of the World Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "While working at the World Bank he was accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, was eventually demoted and then resigned. He has denied the accusations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank’s administrative tribunal last year criticized the way the case was initially handled internally.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tribunal noted that an internal investigation had found that, from 2008 to 2013, Chaves leered at multiple bank employees, made unwelcome comments about their physical appearance, repeated sexual innuendoes and made unwelcome sexual advances. Those details were repeated by the bank’s human resources department in a letter to Chaves, but it decided to sanction him for misconduct rather than sexual harassment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The facts of the present case indicate that [Chaves’] conduct was sexual in nature and that he knew or should have known that his conduct was unwelcome,” the tribunal wrote. The tribunal also noted that in the proceedings, the bank’s current vice president for human resources said in testimony “that the undisputed facts legally amount to sexual harassment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 3.5 million Costa Ricans were eligible to vote, but with many voters underwhelmed by the options, turnout was even lower than the 60% in February.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lines formed before voting started at some polling places in San Jose, the capital, while others appeared nearly empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Political analyst Francisco Barahona said Costa Ricans’ lack of enthusiasm was the result of the multitude of personal attacks that characterized the campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the debates, they only heated things up in personal confrontations, mistreatment of each other,” he said. “They didn’t add depth to their proposals to resolve the country’s problems. The debates didn’t help to motivate the electorate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For a lot of people it’s embarrassing to say they voted for one or the other, and many prefer to say they won’t vote for either of the candidates or simply won’t go to vote,” Barahona added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figueres has been questioned over a $900,000 consulting fee he received after his presidency from the telecommunication company Alcatel while it competed for a contract with the national electricity company. He was never charged with any crime and denied any wrongdoing.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Costa Rica has enjoyed relative democratic stability compared with other countries in the region, the public has grown frustrated with corruption scandals and high unemployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the February vote, Alvarado’s party was practically erased from the political landscape, receiving no seats in the new congress. At the time of that first vote, the country was riding a new wave of coronavirus cases, but infections and hospitalizations have fallen considerably since.\n",
      "Skepticism greets migrant smuggler crackdown in Guatemala\n",
      "Eager to show it’s trying to slow the steady flow of its people north to the United States, Guatemala recently tripled prison sentences for migrant smugglers.\n",
      "\n",

      "While the legal reform is supposed to dissuade smugglers and cast the government as a willing partner of the U.S. in managing migration, experts and lawmakers say it will only make the trip more expensive. The poverty, violence and other factors pushing Guatemalans to migrate remain strong and the smuggling networks continue to ply their trade — sometimes with the help of public officials.\n",

      "Guatemala’s government says it is preparing for further increased migration due to a decision announced Friday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to end a system limiting asylum at the southwestern border on May 23. That policy had been based on reducing the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.\n",

      "In 2020, more than 21,000 Guatemalans were deported home from the U.S., but prosecutors charged only 12 people in connection with migrant smuggling, according to data from the attorney general’s office, said lawmaker Andrea Villagran. Only four of the 12 were convicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have to see the lack of capacity the attorney general’s office has to bring these criminal structures to justice,” said Villagran, who voted against the reform. “The law change is only a show. What this law did was increase the price of smuggling. If the problem isn’t really resolved, the people are going to continue wanting to migrate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Villagran also said there’s little motivation for the government to slow migration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The interest is in continuing to export Guatemalans so they can continue sending remittances and continue sustaining this country’s economy,” she said. Last year, despite the pandemic, Guatemalans sent home $15 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hernández said she decided to leave last month to escape poverty. Her family scraped together thousands of dollars to hire a smuggler, but in a month’s time she was back where she started, now with a massive debt that is virtually unpayable if she stays in Guatemala.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was unaware that the penalties for migrant smuggling had risen to 30 years from 10, now on par with sentences for kidnapping and murder. “Here there’s no work and a lot of violence,” Hernández said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tougher sentences were proposed by the office of President Alejandro Giammattei. His relationship with Washington has been tense, in part because the U.S. government has listed corruption as one of the root causes of immigration in Central America and has accused his administration of undermining Guatemala’s justice system while inventing charges to prosecute anticorruption crusaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ursula Roldán, a migration expert at Rafael Landivar University, said that while poverty and corruption remain rampant, emigration will continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "She notes that deportations from the U.S. have fallen even as Guatemalan emigration continues. “It’s not that people aren’t trying to leave Guatemala. It’s that the containment is in Mexico, at the southern and northern borders,” she said. “That’s where the problem is building.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Guatemalans have featured prominently in recent high-profile — and deadly — smuggling cases in Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January 2021, the incinerated bodies of 19 people, most of them Guatemalan migrants, were found in northern Mexico near the Texas border. Prosecutors said they were shot by a Tamaulipas state police unit and then burned.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December, 55 migrants were killed and more than 100 injured when a semitrailer carrying them crashed in southern Mexico. Again the majority were from Guatemala.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year, Guatemalan authorities, under pressure to show they’re taking smuggling seriously, arrested 10 people suspected of being involved in smuggling the migrants killed last year near the Texas border.\n",
      "\n",
      "“People keep migrating because the structural causes of migration are still there, they haven’t changed,” Roldán said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stuardo Campos, the prosecutor tasked with applying the new law, sees the increased sentences as a positive development and says smuggler arrests are up, but concedes that the factors driving migration are strong and says he lacks the resources to effectively tackle the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Campos noted that the new law requires prosecutors to show proof that moving, housing and helping migrants was done for an economic benefit. That’s a tall order when migrants almost never agree to testify against their smugglers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many smugglers offer a second or third try if the first fails, and migrants have almost no hope of paying off the original debt without reaching the United States. So there’s a large disincentive to helping prosecute their smugglers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Campos laments that lack of cooperation. He has 340 open investigations into migrant smuggling involving 10 smuggling rings operating across Guatemala.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of those killed in northern Mexico, Campos said the leader of the smuggling ring was a former mayor who is now a fugitive.\n",

      "“There are criminal networks within the government that facilitate the entrance and exit and even [false] documents for migrants,” said Villagran, the federal lawmaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The whole system is so coopted that any popularly elected public official could be tied to these networks,” she said. “Ultimately, they need political favors to survive, and those favors translate to financing” of electoral campaigns.\n",

      "Concerns about Bruce Willis’ declining cognitive state swirled around sets in recent years\n",
      "Just days before Bruce Willis was scheduled to turn up on the set of one of his latest action films, the director of the project sent out an urgent request: Make the movie star’s part smaller.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It looks like we need to knock down Bruce’s page count by about 5 pages,” Mike Burns, the director of “Out of Death,” wrote in a June 2020 email to the film’s screenwriter. “We also need to abbreviate his dialogue a bit so that there are no monologues, etc.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Burns did not outline one of the reasons why Willis’ lines needed to be kept “short and sweet.” But on Wednesday, the public learned what he and many other filmmakers have privately been concerned about for years: The 67-year-old’s family said he will retire from acting because he has aphasia. The cognitive disorder affects a person’s ability to communicate and often develops in individuals who have suffered strokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him,” the actor’s daughter Rumer Willis wrote in an Instagram post also signed by her siblings, the actor’s wife, Emma, and his former wife, Demi Moore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "According to those who have worked with the elder Willis on his recent films, the actor has been exhibiting signs of decline in recent years. In interviews with The Times this month, nearly two dozen people who were on set with the actor expressed concern about Willis’ well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "These individuals questioned whether the actor was fully aware of his surroundings on set, where he was often paid $2 million for two days of work, according to documents viewed by The Times. Filmmakers described heart-wrenching scenes as the beloved “Pulp Fiction” star grappled with his loss of mental acuity and an inability to remember his dialogue. An actor who traveled with Willis would feed the star his lines through an earpiece, known in the industry as an “earwig,” according to several sources. Most action scenes, particularly those that involved choreographed gunfire, were filmed using a body double as a substitute for Willis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one alleged incident two years ago on a Cincinnati set of the movie “Hard Kill,” Willis unexpectedly fired a gun loaded with a blank on the wrong cue, according to two people familiar with the incident who were not authorized to comment. No one was injured. The film’s producer disputed that the incident occurred, but the alleged discharge left actors and crew members shaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burns was one of a handful of people who knew Willis was struggling with his memory, but he said he was unaware of the severity of the actor’s condition until June 2020, when he was directing his first film, “Out of Death.” It was among 22 films Willis did in four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After the first day of working with Bruce, I could see it firsthand and I realized that there was a bigger issue at stake here and why I had been asked to shorten his lines,” Burns said. On that film, Burns was tasked with compressing all of Willis’ scenes — about 25 pages of dialogue — into one day of filming, which he said was exceedingly difficult. At the end of the day, Burns felt conflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last fall, Burns was offered the chance to direct another Willis film, “Wrong Place,” but he was worried about the actor’s health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burns said he called one of Willis’ associates and asked him: “How’s Bruce?” Burns said he was told that Willis was “a whole different person ... way better than last year.” “I took him at his word,” Burns said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they started filming the movie last October, “I didn’t think he was better; I thought he was worse,” Burns said. “After we finished, I said: ‘I’m done. I’m not going to do any other Bruce Willis movies.’ I am relieved that he is taking time off.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A representative for Willis declined to comment beyond the family statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Willis’ longtime management team — including a powerhouse group of agents at the Creative Artists Agency — made sure that his film shoots were limited to two days. The actor’s contracts stipulated that he was not to work more than eight hours a day, but he often stayed for only four, according to production sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, fans online began questioning why Willis was cranking out so many low-budget films, most of which were panned by critics. The group behind the Razzie Awards, which each year compiles a list of the industry’s worst films, in February created an entire category for Willis’ films.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some film directors told The Times that they were startled by Willis’ condition in the last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jesse V. Johnson, who directed the low-budget film “White Elephant,” first worked with Willis decades ago when he was a stuntman. But when the filmmaker and the actor met briefly before shooting began in Georgia last April, “it was clear that he was not the Bruce I remembered,” Johnson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerned about Willis’ mental state, he said he approached the actor’s team — which is led by his assistant-turned-handler Stephen J. Eads — and bluntly asked about the actor’s condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They stated that he was happy to be there, but that it would be best if we could finish shooting him by lunch and let him go early,” Johnson recalled of the conversation. Filmmakers proceeded to quickly film the actor’s parts, even as Willis questioned where he was: “I know why you’re here, and I know why you’re here, but why am I here?” two crew members said he asked aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was less of an annoyance and more like: ‘How do we not make Bruce look bad?’” one of the crew members said. “Someone would give him a line and he didn’t understand what it meant. He was just being puppeted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Johnson, the director, said he subsequently was offered the opportunity to film two additional movies with Willis, so he discussed the situation with his creative team.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After our experience on ‘White Elephant,’ it was decided as a team that we would not do another,” Johnson said. “We are all Bruce Willis fans, and the arrangement felt wrong and ultimately a rather sad end to an incredible career, one that none of us felt comfortable with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he has appeared in more than 70 films since he began acting in the 1970s, Willis is still best recognized for playing detective John McClane in the “Die Hard” franchise. The role — which he reprised in five movies — helped to cement his status as one of Hollywood’s leading action heroes, landing him parts in films such as “Pulp Fiction” and “The Fifth Element.” Although he was often recognized more as a box office draw than a critical darling, he received a Golden Globe for his role opposite Cybill Shepherd in the 1980s television series “Moonlighting” and has worked with directors such as Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as Willis’ health declined, he remained in high demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "His involvement in films — even if for a fleeting few minutes — helped low-budget independent filmmakers sell their films internationally. Having Willis’ face on a movie poster or a lineup of streaming service thumbnails helped draw viewers to his films. In recent years, Willis worked primarily for two film production companies: Los Angeles-based Emmett/Furla Oasis and 308 Entertainment Inc., a Vancouver company backed by actor and producer Corey Large, according to IMDb.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January 2020, actress Lala Kent, a star of Bravo’s “Vanderpump Rules” reality show, was cast as the action hero’s daughter in “Hard Kill.” In one scene, Kent said, Willis’ character was scripted to step in and protect her from villains.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m supposed to think my life is about to end, and then my dad steps in to save the day,” Kent said, describing how her back was to Willis in the scene. Willis was meant to deliver a line that served as Kent’s cue to duck before he fired the weapon at a bad guy. Instead, he shot the gun before delivering the line — and the actress was unable to duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because my back was to him, I wasn’t aware of what was happening behind me. But the first time, it was like, ‘No big deal, let’s reset,’” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kent said she asked director Matt Eskandari to remind Willis to say his line before firing the gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the second take, the same thing happened, Kent said. Eskandari did not respond to calls seeking comment, but a second crew member said he remembered Kent being shaken that day. A third crew member, who also was not authorized to comment publicly, said he recalled a situation in which Willis “did fire the gun on the wrong line.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the crew member added: “We always made sure no one was in the line of fire when he was handling guns.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Randall Emmett, co-founder of Emmett/Furla Oasis, who has worked on 20 Willis movies, declined to comment on Willis’ condition, citing medical privacy laws. But Emmett, who is Kent’s former fiance, disputed that Willis fired a gun prematurely. The film’s armorer denied that the incident occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement, Emmett said: “I fully support Bruce and his family during this challenging time and admire him for his courage in battling this difficult medical condition. Bruce will always be a part of our family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Willis had a large entourage that accompanied him on set, and its members were protective of the actor, according to several filmmakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eads, who began working with Willis as his assistant in the 1990s, served as his on-set handler.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The guy guided Bruce everywhere,” one crew member on 2020’s “Hard Kill” said of Eads. “He carted him around and kept an eye on him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For his work, he is credited as a producer on Willis’ films. In December 2018, Eads entered into a three-picture deal with the now-defunct MoviePass Films for which Eads received $200,000 per picture, according to a contract reviewed by the The Times.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We look forward to continuing our long relationship with you on these and other films to come,” read the deal sent to Eads by Emmett, the chief executive of the production company. Just over a year later, Eads entered into a new certificate of engagement for $200,000 with Georgia Film Fund 70 LLC — another of Emmett’s companies — to work on “Hard Kill,” then called “Open Source.” Eads did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, actor Adam Huel Potter was guaranteed bit roles in Willis films and served as Willis’ prompter, providing the actor his lines through the ear piece. Potter was paid $4,150 per week, according to Willis’ contract on “Open Source.” He was offered “an on-screen speaking role” and provided with accommodations in Willis’ hotel, according to the document. Potter did not respond to inquiries from The Times about this arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of Willis’ final larger-scale films, “Paradise City,” was filmed on the Hawaiian island of Maui last May, after the pandemic delayed production for a year. Chuck Russell, the film’s director, and a second crew member said Willis was thrilled to be reunited with a fellow “Pulp Fiction” star in Hawaii. (The film is scheduled for release this summer.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was excited to work with John Travolta, and you could see the old Bruce Willis charm was still there,” Russell said. “He really brought his A game, and we made sure that he and John had a great experience filming together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the filmmakers who spoke with The Times said they were alarmed by his condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He just looked so lost, and he would say, ‘I’ll do my best.’ He always tried his best,” Terri Martin, the production supervisor on “White Elephant,” said Wednesday. “He is one of the all-time greats, and I have the utmost admiration and respect for his body of work, but it was time for him to retire.”\n"

      "What to know about mass shootings FAQ How do we define a mass shooting? Mass shootings are defined as a shooting with four or more people killed — not including the shooter — in a public location with firearms, as defined by the Congressional Research Service . Are mass shootings related to mental illness? Most people who have and live with a mental illness are nonviolent . Most shooters experienced early childhood trauma and exposure to violence at a young age, and most shooters have studied the actions of other shooters and sought validation for their motives. According to the Violence Project — a nonprofit, nonpartisan research center dedicated to reducing violence in society — the role of serious mental illness in mass shootings is complex . The project reports that more than 80% of mass shooters were in a notable crisis prior to the shooting. Psychosis played no role for nearly 70% of mass shooters, according to the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, seek help from a professional and call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-TALK (8255). Text “HOME” to 741741 in the U.S. and Canada to reach the Crisis Text Line . Are mass shootings becoming more deadly and more common? Yes, mass shootings have been getting more deadly over the decades. James Densley and Jillian Peterson, who run the Violence Project and have studied every public mass shooting since 1966, write that more than half of the shootings have occurred since 2000 and 33% since 2010. They write that for decades, the toll of mass shootings has risen steadily. During the 1970s, mass shootings claimed an average of 5.7 lives per year. In 2019, the average figure was 51 deaths per year . In 2020, mass shootings were far less frequent during the COVID-19 pandemic, as schools, offices and churches shut down. Now they’re ticking back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the contagion effect? Most shooters have studied the actions of other shooters and want validation for their motives, according to James Densley and Jillian Peterson of the Violence Project . That’s why mass shootings can come in clusters and can be socially contagious, a phenomenon called the contagion effect. Research also shows how media reports on mass shootings can play a role in the contagion effect or copycat incidents, according to Dr. Dan Reidenberg from Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE) at a Poynter seminar on mass shootings. Responsible and helpful reporting can inform and educate the public and possibly reduce the risk of violence, according to the seminar. How can you talk to your child about mass shootings? Check in with your child and talk to them about their concerns. Reassure them that they are safe (which is good advice for all trauma survivors). Tailor conversations and topics to what’s appropriate for your child’s age. Limit their exposure to media coverage of shootings. Maintain routines and model healthy behavior as parents. Have a plan with your children in case of an emergency. Also, watch for changes in their behavior, sleep, mood and appetite. Every child responds to trauma differently and can show signs of stress at different times, according to the American Psychological Assn. SHOW MORE SHOW LESS\n",

      "Bruce Willis’ aphasia battle: Living in a country where you don’t speak the language\n",
      "Living with aphasia has been compared to living in a country where you don’t speak the language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gestures, sign language or other forms of communication may not be much help. And the people who want to help you struggle to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know what things are. You are the person you were — but others don’t know that,” said Lyn Turkstra, a professor of speech-language pathology and neuroscience at McMaster University in Canada. “All of a sudden, you can’t express thoughts and feelings as you once could, and if it is progressive, you’re feeling it slip away gradually.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bruce Willis’ retirement from a four-decade acting career after an aphasia diagnosis has put the little-known disorder in the spotlight. People living with aphasia, as well as their caregivers and advocates for treatment of the disorder, say they hope his diagnosis will help reduce the stigma of invisible illnesses and lead to better understanding of a frustrating, isolating condition that affects about 2 million Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Willis’ diagnosis has already sparked a surge of interest in the condition, said Darlene Williamson, the volunteer president of the National Aphasia Assn., a nonprofit organization that helps patients and their caregivers. The Willis family’s news echoes other celebrity health decisions, including Betty Ford’s 1974 battle with breast cancer, Michael J. Fox’s disclosure in 1998 that he had Parkinson’s disease, and Angelina Jolie’s preventive double mastectomy in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How many people have ever heard of aphasia? Pitifully few,” Williamson said. “If you tell someone, ‘I have aphasia,’ they have no idea what it is. Just for the word itself to be meaningful is a huge desire for our community.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Aphasia is not a cognitive disorder and does not affect intelligence. Most frequently triggered by strokes or other brain trauma, the condition makes it difficult to speak, to find the proper words and to understand what is said or written. In less frequent cases, aphasia can be brought on by neurodegenerative diseases that cause cognitive issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "For both types of aphasia, the resulting communication difficulties can lead to shame, embarrassment and frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The general public assumes that if someone doesn’t respond, they are intellectually challenged,” said Roberta DePompei, a retired professor of speech-language pathology at the University of Akron. “They are treated like a child, when inside, they are still the same person. It becomes humiliating to be treated that way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The condition is more common than Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis but far less known. Two years ago, 86.2% of Americans had not heard of aphasia, while about 7% knew that it was a communication disorder, according to a survey by the National Aphasia Assn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Language is “one of the things that make humans really human,” said Dr. Mario F. Mendez, a behavioral neurologist at UCLA. Because aphasia affects a person’s ability to use symbols — whether words, sign language, musical notations, even Morse code — the condition can be difficult to work around.\n",
      "\n",
      "How aphasia affects someone and how it can be treated vary widely. Mendez said he recently saw three distinct aphasia patients in one day: the first struggled to remember certain words; a second distorted the pronunciation; and a third simply couldn’t understand what the doctor was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient who couldn’t recall terms was able to express himself by explaining around them and is a good candidate for speech therapy. Meanwhile, the visit with the patient who struggled to understand language led to “a very difficult conversation with his wife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For patients whose aphasia is brought on by “insidious, slowly progressive” degeneration, rather than a stroke, an early warning sign is often trouble finding a word, Mendez said. Sometimes called the “tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon,” people are forced to stop midsentence and search for what should come next.\n",
      "\n",
      "That type of aphasia, called primary progressive, is understudied and underdiagnosed, in part because people are afraid to go to the doctor when they start experiencing warning signs, Williamson said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early diagnosis and intervention are key so patients can start language therapy and develop a system of communication for when speech eventually fails, she said. Talking to a doctor, a speech therapist and a support group will give families more time to sort out finances and decision-making duties, and to set expectations for how life can take shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "With good medical care and speech therapy, most patients whose aphasia is related to a stroke or another brain injury should see some improvement, Williamson said. People whose aphasia is brought on by cognitive decline should not expect the same outcome, she said, and should instead focus on “maintaining for as long as possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether people living with aphasia can participate fully in society, including working, depends on the severity of their case and whether they are facing other health issues stemming from the same incident that caused the aphasia, such as mobility problems caused by a stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who worked with the 67-year-old Willis on recent films raised concerns that he did not seem to be fully aware of his surroundings and struggled to remember his lines, The Times has reported. Productions reworked their schedules and scripts to compress his dialogue and the amount of time he spent shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "An actor who traveled with the star fed his dialogue through an earpiece, known in the industry as an “earwig,” according to several sources. Most action scenes, particularly those that involved choreographed gunfire, were filmed using a body double.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No matter what the cause of aphasia, there’s no cure,” Williamson said. “Almost no one who’s diagnosed with aphasia is ever 100% who they were before. We never talk in terms of a cure. We talk in terms of living successfully and returning to participation in life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people with aphasia may be able to return to work with reasonable accommodation. For example, if their disorder makes it harder for them to type, they could dictate rather than write, Williamson said. Others may choose to find another line of work that isn’t as taxing, or turn to volunteering rather than working full time.\n",
      "\n",
      "People living with aphasia that is coupled with cognitive decline, she said, “do continue to work for a period of time until it just doesn’t make sense anymore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been advancements in how the condition is treated.\n",
      "\n",
      "When DePompei, the retired speech-language pathologist, began helping patients with aphasia more than 40 years ago, the manuals at the time recommended practicing with words in categorical lists, and there were picture cards. One typical session might focus on the kitchen: “Stove.” “Refrigerator.” “Eggs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, she said, understanding of the condition is more nuanced and practical, addressing not just the mechanics of speech but the social and psychological dimensions related to its loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Each of us has something we want to communicate,” she said. “Finding out how to keep an individual with aphasia supported in the community in which they have always lived is essential.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Often this means working with cellphones or tablets and breaking through the social isolation that being speechless entails. Sometimes, she said, it is more important to say, “I love you,” or “Turn on the TV,” or “I’m hungry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Williamson said people living with aphasia have been helped enormously by smartphones, which allow them to order meals, find taxis and make doctor’s appointments without speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The news of Willis’ diagnosis has sparked hope that, with increased awareness, more money could be raised to find a cure or better treatments for aphasia. Two years after Fox announced his Parkinson’s diagnosis, he created a research foundation that has raised more than $1 billion to find a cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aphasia brought on by a stroke or another brain injury is not always a one-way street toward deeper isolation. The brain’s elasticity sometimes allows for new connections to be made across broken circuits, especially in the case of injuries or strokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sara Culver was 42 when she suffered a high blood pressure stroke that led to her aphasia. Almost 20 years later, she has recovered, and together with her husband, Tim, volunteers with the Aphasia Recovery Connection sharing her story with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The stroke completely destroyed her speech center and affected her right side,” said Tim Culver. She spent three months in the hospital and three more at the Centre for Neuro Skills in Irving, Texas, near where they live. She had her own apartment and, with the help of a caregiver, began finding the words that she had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Culver estimates it took his wife about 10 years to get back to where she was, and today she is working again, tutoring students at the local college in mathematics and algebra.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They told me she would plateau at six months,” Culver said. “But she continually improves in her ability to speak. It takes time, but people can regain their ability to communicate.”\n"

      "Man arrested on assault, firearms possession charges in Sacramento mass shooting\n",
      "As Sacramento mourned the worst mass shooting in the United States this year with sidewalk shrines near the Capitol, authorities on Monday arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect, Dandre Martin, 26, was booked on assault and possession of an illegal firearm charges, authorities said, adding that they’ve executed several search warrants and recovered a handgun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities also identified the six people who were killed early Sunday in a barrage of gunfire outside a stretch of popular downtown nightclubs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dead include three men and three women. The youngest victims, Johntaya Alexander and Yamile Martinez-Andrade, were both 21 years old. The oldest victim, Melinda Davis, was 57, according to the Sacramento County coroner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "Also identified were Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32; Devazia Turner, 29; and Sergio Harris, 38, who was previously identified by family members.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven of the 12 injured victims being treated at hospitals were reported to have been released. Authorities remained at the crime scene until early Monday, where hundreds of evidence markers were laid out on the pavement, including vestiges of at least 75 shots fired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The scale of violence that just happened in our city is unprecedented during my 27 years here,” said Sacramento City Police Chief Kathy Lester during a Sunday news conference at police headquarters. “We are shocked and heartbroken by this tragedy. But we are also resolved as an agency to find those responsible and to secure justice for the victims and the families.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Police were searching for what they called “multiple shooters” Sunday evening, and offered few details about what happened or why except to say that just after 2 a.m., a car drove up 10th Street and unleashed a sustained fusillade of bullets into a crowd of people before fleeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least one other person fired a gun, although it was not yet clear whether that person was in the car or in the crowd firing back at the car shooter. It was not even certain Sunday whether that was the only crime scene, because a victim was also transported from another location a block away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The killings took place on and near the city’s K Street mall, within view of the grand white dome of the state Capitol, where in recent years lawmakers have enacted the nation’s toughest gun control laws but remain confounded by how to stem mass shootings. Already this year, Sacramento has been shaken by two of the four worst spasms of gun violence in the nation, including an incident in February when a man killed his three children, a man supervising their family visit, and himself.\n",

      "\n",
      "Police radio traffic and videos posted to the internet revealed a chaotic series of events early Sunday. A melee broke out in front of a club just before the shooting, although it was not clear whether it was related or just a coincidence. Afterward, three men and three women were killed in the street. Many more people were transported away in ambulances, while at least two people dragged themselves to hospitals for treatment of gunshot wounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least one handgun — later discovered to be stolen — was recovered. The rapid gunfire heard on videos suggested a semiautomatic weapon may have been used, but a police spokesman, citing the ongoing investigation, did not offer information on the weapon used.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This morning our city has a broken heart. This is a senseless and unacceptable tragedy,” Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said at a news conference. “Thoughts and prayers aren’t nearly enough. We must do more as a city, as a state and as a nation. This senseless epidemic of gun violence must be addressed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Steinberg’s office said the city plans to hold a vigil for the victims at 7:30 p.m. Monday at Ali Youssefi Square in downtown.\n",
      "\n",
      "A block from where the mayor and other city leaders spoke, family members of some of the victims gathered at a line of police tape on 10th and L streets, staring at a desolate scene of asphalt pocked with blue plastic tags marking shell casings.\n",

      "\n",
      "Harris’ father, Fred, said he had been circling the streets around the crime scene since 2:30 a.m., looking to make sense of things. His daughter, Kay, had called him to report that her brother had been shot. “I hope people are brought to justice,” Kay Harris said, before pulling her father away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred Harris Jr., 41, described his younger brother, Sergio, as a “pretty good guy, well rounded and well liked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody pretty much knew him and loved him for being who he was,” he said. “Everybody who knew Serg just knew he was all about a good time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He said Sergio was a father to three kids, two girls and a boy, and that he loved his cars, shoes and drinking Champagne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harris said that everyone is “pretty distraught” and that his phone has been going off all day. He is not on the scene, but said that his father, sister and stepmother are there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harris heard that several fights broke out and that a car came down the street “and started letting off a bunch of shots.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not sure if it’s associated with the fights that were happening at the clubs, or it was one of those random occurrences of violence,” he said. “I feel like my brother wasn’t targeted. I feel like it was a random act of violence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody’s going to remember Sergio, he was just a good guy, well liked in the community. He did everything for everybody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "DeVazia Turner was Sergio Harris’ cousin, according to family.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He was a young man of the streets, he was a good guy,” Turner’s father told a TV reporter at the scene. “He was at a party, at a club. As I understand, he walked out the club and walked into some s— and got shot... Tell these young men to stay out the streets, quit playing these games.”\n",
      "\n",
      "John Alexander, the father of one of the youngest victims, Johntaya, was awakened by a phone call just after 2 a.m. Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was his daughter Johntezha and he could hear terror in her voice, as she explained that she was cradling her younger sister in her arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Daddy,” she said, “Taya’s been shot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re lying,” he said in disbelief.\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped out of bed, threw on clothes and drove toward the entertainment district. When Alexander arrived at the scene, he saw someone trying to resuscitate a man who had crumpled to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, his eyes shifted toward his little girl. His beautiful, strong-willed daughter, whose name was a combination of his own and his older sister’s, whose energy she shared. His daughter, who adored her nieces and nephews and dreamed of one day becoming a social worker so she could work with children.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was already gone,” Alexander said, softly. “Lifeless.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, he said, that image has been replaying in his mind on repeat. He’s trying to focus, instead, on joyful memories — on holidays and birthdays past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Johntaya, he said, would have turned 22 on the last day of the month.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She was just beginning her life,” he said, sobbing. “Stop all this senseless shooting.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lester vowed that her department would find and arrest those responsible, but emphasized that detectives were facing a “really complex and complicated scene” involving “hundreds of pieces of evidence,” including video from a police camera that captured portions of the shooting along with videos submitted by the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The yellow police tape sealing off the K Street mall added more pain to a Sacramento district that was struggling before the COVID-19 pandemic, but more so now, with fewer lobbyists buying lunches and drinks at bars and restaurants. Crowds show up on weekends and nights when the Golden 1 Center hosts the Sacramento Kings and arena concerts, including one on Saturday night featuring Tyler, the Creator. Other times, the mall is largely empty, especially on its blighted west side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lester said officers on the beat in the downtown core heard the gunshots ring out just after 2 a.m. and came running. They saw a horrific scene: Bullets pocked the street and buildings while 18 people were dead, dying or wounded. It was believed to be the largest mass shooting in Sacramento history.\n",

      "Officers immediately began to give medical aid and perform CPR. Police and fire radio traffic gave a window into the horror. “I’m getting reports from [Sacramento police] that we may have more victims, up to 10,” one dispatcher said. “Go ahead and start me five more ambulances, another command unit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As they began to piece together what happened, police learned that a large group of people had been fighting in the street moments before the shots rang out, but officers said they did not yet know whether that melee was related to the shooting. They are reviewing videos, from the public and from fixed cameras, to try to piece it all together.\n",

      "What to know about mass shootings FAQ How do we define a mass shooting? Mass shootings are defined as a shooting with four or more people killed — not including the shooter — in a public location with firearms, as defined by the Congressional Research Service . Are mass shootings related to mental illness? Most people who have and live with a mental illness are nonviolent . Most shooters experienced early childhood trauma and exposure to violence at a young age, and most shooters have studied the actions of other shooters and sought validation for their motives. According to the Violence Project — a nonprofit, nonpartisan research center dedicated to reducing violence in society — the role of serious mental illness in mass shootings is complex . The project reports that more than 80% of mass shooters were in a notable crisis prior to the shooting. Psychosis played no role for nearly 70% of mass shooters, according to the report.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, seek help from a professional and call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-TALK (8255). Text “HOME” to 741741 in the U.S. and Canada to reach the Crisis Text Line . Are mass shootings becoming more deadly and more common? Yes, mass shootings have been getting more deadly over the decades. James Densley and Jillian Peterson, who run the Violence Project and have studied every public mass shooting since 1966, write that more than half of the shootings have occurred since 2000 and 33% since 2010. They write that for decades, the toll of mass shootings has risen steadily. During the 1970s, mass shootings claimed an average of 5.7 lives per year. In 2019, the average figure was 51 deaths per year . In 2020, mass shootings were far less frequent during the COVID-19 pandemic, as schools, offices and churches shut down. Now they’re ticking back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the contagion effect? Most shooters have studied the actions of other shooters and want validation for their motives, according to James Densley and Jillian Peterson of the Violence Project . That’s why mass shootings can come in clusters and can be socially contagious, a phenomenon called the contagion effect. Research also shows how media reports on mass shootings can play a role in the contagion effect or copycat incidents, according to Dr. Dan Reidenberg from Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE) at a Poynter seminar on mass shootings. Responsible and helpful reporting can inform and educate the public and possibly reduce the risk of violence, according to the seminar. How can you talk to your child about mass shootings? Check in with your child and talk to them about their concerns. Reassure them that they are safe (which is good advice for all trauma survivors). Tailor conversations and topics to what’s appropriate for your child’s age. Limit their exposure to media coverage of shootings. Maintain routines and model healthy behavior as parents. Have a plan with your children in case of an emergency. Also, watch for changes in their behavior, sleep, mood and appetite. Every child responds to trauma differently and can show signs of stress at different times, according to the American Psychological Assn. SHOW MORE SHOW LESS\n",

Yet temperatures have already increased by over 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, resulting in measurable increases in disasters such as flash floods, prolonged droughts, more intense hurricanes and longer-burning wildfires, putting human lives in danger and costing governments hundreds of billions of dollars to confront.\n",

      "“Projected global emissions from [national pledges] place limiting global warming to 1.5C beyond reach and make it harder after 2030 to limit warming to 2C,” the panel said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the report’s co-chair, James Skea of Imperial College London, told the Associated Press: “If we continue acting as we are now, we’re not even going to limit warming to 2 degrees, never mind 1.5 degrees.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ongoing investments in fossil fuel infrastructure and clearing large swaths of forest for agriculture undermine the massive curbs in emissions needed to meet the Paris goal, the report found.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To keep the 1.5-degree limit agreed in Paris within reach, we need to cut global emissions by 45% this decade,” said Guterres, the U.N. chief. “But current climate pledges would mean a 14% increase in emissions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a summary negotiated with governments over the last two weeks, the panel concluded that returning warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100 would require removing vast amounts of carbon dioxide — the main greenhouse gas — from the atmosphere. Many experts say this is unfeasible with current technologies, and even if it could be done, it would be far costlier than preventing the emissions in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report’s authors said they had “high confidence” that unless countries step up their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the planet will on average be 2.4 to 3.5 degrees Celsius (4.3 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer by the end of the century — a level experts say is sure to cause severe impacts for much of the world’s population.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are on a pathway to global warming of more than double the 1.5-degree limit agreed in Paris,” Guterres said. “Some government and business leaders are saying one thing — but doing another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Simply put, they are lying,” he added. “And the results will be catastrophic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the tough words by Guterres and report co-chairs, the full report, numbering thousands of pages but condensed into a summary by governments and scientists, doesn’t single out individual countries for blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the figures show much of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere was released by rich countries that were the first to burn coal, oil and gas when the industrial revolution really got going in the 1850s.\n",

      "The U.N. panel said about 40% of emissions since then have come from Europe and North America. Just over 12% can be attributed to East Asia, which includes China. The country took over the position as world’s top emitter from the United States in the mid-2000s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report isn’t without some hope, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its authors highlight myriad ways in which the world can be brought back on track to 2 degrees Celsius or even, with great effort, return to 1.5 degrees Celsius after that threshold has been passed. This could require measures such as the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere with natural or artificial means, but also potentially risky technologies such as pumping aerosols into the sky to reflect sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the solutions recommended are a rapid shift away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy such as solar and wind, the electrification of transport, more efficient use of resources and massive financial support for poor countries unable to pay for such measures without help.\n",
      "\n",
      "One move often described as “low-hanging fruit” by scientists is to plug methane leaks from mines, wells and landfills that release the potent but short-lived greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. A pact forged between the United States and China at last year’s U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, aims to do just that.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can see the first signs that the actions that people are taking are beginning to make a difference,” said Skea, the panel’s co-chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The big message we’ve got [is that] human activities got us into this problem and human agency can actually get us out of it again,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The panel’s reports have become increasingly blunt since the first one was published in 1990, and the latest may be the last before the planet passes 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, Skea told the AP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last August, it said climate change caused by humans was “an established fact” and warned that some effects of global warming are already inevitable. In late February, the panel published a report that outlined how further temperature increases will multiply the risk of floods, storms, drought and heat waves worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the British government’s former chief science advisor David King, who wasn’t involved in writing the report, said there are optimistic assumptions about how much CO2 the world can afford to emit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.N. panel suggests there’s still a “carbon budget” of 500 billion metric tons (550 billion U.S. tons) that can be emitted before hitting the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t actually have a remaining carbon budget to burn,” said King, who now chairs the Climate Crisis Advisory Group.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s just the reverse. We’ve already done too much in the way of putting greenhouse gases up there,” he said, arguing that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s calculation omits new risks and potentially self-reinforcing effects already happening in some places, such as the increased absorption of heat into the oceans from sea ice loss and the release of methane as permafrost melts, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such warnings were echoed by U.N. chief Guterres, citing scientists’ warnings that the planet is moving “perilously close to tipping points that could lead to cascading and irreversible climate impacts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But high-emitting governments and corporations are not just turning a blind eye; they are adding fuel to the flames,” he said, calling for an end to further coal, oil and gas extraction that the report said might have to be abandoned anyway, resulting in losses of trillions of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness,” said Guterres.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vulnerable nations said the report showed big polluters have to step up their efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are looking to the G-20, to the world’s biggest emitters, to set ambitious targets ahead of [climate change conference] COP27, and to reach those targets — by investing in renewables, cutting out coal and fossil fuel subsidies,” said Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands. “It’s long past time to deliver on promises made.”\n"

      "\n",
      "One shows a large group of people fighting on the street, followed by rapid gunfire. Another captures multiple volleys of gunfire, including what sounds like a possible automatic weapon, before people on the street run for their lives.\n",

      "More than a day after the shooting, many questions remain unanswered. Police arrested on suspect on Monday. A motive is not clear.\n",

      "What led up to the shooting?\n",
      "\n",
      "A video emerged showing a group of people fighting before shots rang out. Sacramento police said they believed a fight might have sparked the gunfire but were unclear about what prompted the conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At this point we don’t know this information,” police spokesman Zachary Eaton said. “Our investigators are still working through what actually led up to the fight. We understand there are some social media video out there depicting a fight. We don’t know if that fight actually led to the shooting. We are still working through all those details right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a video out in the community that appears to depict rapid fire,” he said. “But we are still working through the investigator report, so I can’t confirm that right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What about the shooting itself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Police were searching for what they said were multiple shooters but did not say how many. One suspect, Dandre Martin, 26, was booked on assault and possession of an illegal firearm charges, authorities said, adding that they’ve executed several search warrants and recovered a handgun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities suspect that an unidentified person drove through the scene and opened fire on a crowd of people before fleeing, according to a law enforcement source. The official spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity to discuss the case candidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least one other person fired a gun, although it was not yet clear whether that person was also in the car or in the crowd firing back. It was not even certain whether that was the only crime scene, as a victim was also transported from another location a block away.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least one handgun — later discovered to be stolen — was recovered. The rapid gunfire heard on videos suggested that, in addition to a semiautomatic gun, an automatic weapon may have been used. But a police spokesman, citing the ongoing investigation, would not comment on what is known about the weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three men and three women were killed in the street. Many more people were taken away in ambulances, while at least two people dragged themselves to hospitals for treatment of gunshot wounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked whether any victims were targeted specifically, Eaton said: “At this point, we don’t know the answers to that question, unfortunately. That is something we are going to be looking into. Motive is obviously always a key part of the investigations, so we will definitely be looking at that aspect.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the handgun that was found, “I don’t have any details of what kind of handgun it was,” Eaton said. “It was found within the scene that we have roped off downtown… I don’t know exactly where it was found, but I know it was found within that scene.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What do we know about the victims?\n",
      "\n",
      "The dead include three men and three women. The youngest victims, Johntaya Alexander and Yamile Martinez-Andrade, were both 21 years old. The oldest victim, Melinda Davis, was 57, according to the Sacramento County coroner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also identified were Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32; Devazia Turner, 29; and Sergio Harris, 38, who was previously identified by family members.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven of the 12 injured victims being treated at hospitals were reported to have been released.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fred Harris Jr., 41, described his younger brother, Sergio, as “well rounded and well liked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody pretty much knew him and loved him for being who he was,” he said. “Everybody who knew Serg just knew he was all about a good time.”\n",

      "He said Sergio was a father to three children, two girls and a boy.\n",
